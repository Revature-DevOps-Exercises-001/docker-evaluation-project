# Docker Evaluation Project - Java Curriculum

## Overview
This project is to serve as an evaluation of an associate's ability to implement Docker and docker-compose on an existing legacy codebase. Each associate will provide an existing Maven project that consists JUnit test cases and a starter Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yaml file.

## Prerequisites & Setup
- Installations: Docker on Windows, Linux, and Macintosh.

## Instructions
Part 1: Containerize your application and start your own Docker container.
Part 2: Build images with Docker for existing projects and run them.
Part 3: Manage complex multi-container applications with docker-compose.
Part 4: Run your entire application within an AWS EC2.
Part 5: Optimize images sizes and security for production and find out why docker-compose is not an optimal production solution and what is.

## Submission
Passing this evaluation requires you to do each & every exercise. 

Each exercise is worth 1-3 credits depending on the completed sub-parts.
```
Example:
Completing part 1 gives you 1 credit within that exercise. Completing parts 1 and 2 is worth 2 credits. Completing all of the parts will grant you 3 credits.
```
There will be an area in which the associate will submit screenshots of the code working as well as submit their repos into their organization as `Docker-Evaluation-[associate-name]`.
